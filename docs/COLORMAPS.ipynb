While an image is worth a thousand words, the interpretation of an image is subjective.  The presentation of an image can strongly affect how human eyes identify features.  This is especially true for two-dimensional intensity maps, where the value of each pixel is represented by a color.  A poorly chosen colormap between values and colors can fool the human eyes to, e.g., pick out non-existing features, or to hide important features.\n",
